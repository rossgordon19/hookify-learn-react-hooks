# Hookify - React Hooks Learning Dashboard

A modern, interactive dashboard for learning and practicing React Hooks.

## Purpose

I created this project to refresh my React knowledge and deepen my understanding of React Hooks. Hookify provides a sandboxed environment to experiment with various hooks, allowing me (and others) to write and instantly preview code examples. Each hook has its own dedicated JavaScript and CSS editor, making it easy to focus on one concept at a time.

## Tech Stack

- **React** 
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Monaco Editor**
- **Babel**
- **React Split**

## Development

I built this project as a personal learning exercise. While I used Cursor to help set up the initial UI, code editor, and preview functionality, I wrote all the actual implementation, logic, and hook examples myself as part of my React refresher journey.

The interface provides a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
